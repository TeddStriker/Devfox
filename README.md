# Devfox
Minor edit to the firefox developer edition theme. Made mostly by simple edits from different public sources, here mostly for safekeeping.

To use the CSS, first enable the developer theme in about:config, this should be possible in any firefox edition.

`browser.devedition.theme.enabled > true` To enable the theme.

`devtools.theme > dark` To set it to dark.

Then simply add the CSS code to your userchrome.css, or use stylish and create a new style.
